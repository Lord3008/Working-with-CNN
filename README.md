## Working with CNNs:
This repository showcases my work in CNNs to explore the building blocks of CNNs, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and activation functions.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep neural networks primarily used for analyzing visual data. They have proven highly effective in tasks such as image and video recognition, image classification, medical image analysis, and other areas involving spatial data.

### Key Components:
1. **Convolutional Layers**: These layers apply convolution operations to the input data, using filters (kernels) to extract features such as edges, textures, and patterns. Convolutions help in capturing local spatial relationships within the input.
2. **Pooling Layers**: Pooling layers (e.g., max pooling) reduce the spatial dimensions of the data, which decreases the number of parameters and computation, and helps control overfitting. Pooling operations summarize the presence of features in patches of the input.
3. **Activation Functions**: Non-linear functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) are applied to introduce non-linearity into the model, enabling it to learn complex patterns.
4. **Fully Connected Layers**: These layers connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the next layer, often used towards the end of the network for classification tasks.
5. **Dropout**: A regularization technique used to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to zero during training.

### Example Architecture:
A typical CNN for image classification might include:
- Input layer: Raw image data.
- Convolutional layer: Applies several filters to extract features.
- ReLU activation: Adds non-linearity.
- Pooling layer: Downsamples the feature maps.
- Fully connected layer: Combines all the features and feeds them into a classifier.

### Basic Code Example (Using TensorFlow/Keras):
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### Applications:
- **Image Classification**: Identifying objects within an image.
- **Object Detection**: Detecting and locating objects in an image.
- **Image Segmentation**: Dividing an image into meaningful segments.
- **Facial Recognition**: Recognizing and verifying human faces.

CNNs are powerful because they automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images, making them a fundamental tool in computer vision and image processing.
